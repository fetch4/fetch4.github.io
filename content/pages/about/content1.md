Methane is a key component of the global carbon cycle, and understanding the processes controlling the abundance of atmospheric methane is profoundly important for understanding future climate and mitigation options. Major sources of methane include both natural- and human-driven pathways, including wetlands, fossil fuels, agriculture, landfills, and fires. Atmospheric methane concentrations have exhibited large variations over time, and have rapidly grown since 2020, yet the drivers of these variations remain scientifically elusive. Scientists know variations can be driven by other aspects of atmospheric chemistry as well, which are also currently poorly understood.

To fill these gaps, the FETCH<sub>4</sub> team will collect data from both Greenland ice cores and air samples from stations around the world and measure their unique chemical fingerprints. Their goal is to single out individual aspects of the methane cycle, such as those coming from fossil fuel emissions, and identify both their sources and sinks. Using what they learn, the team will develop and sharpen the capability of global climate models to account for methane. Scientists hope that by creating more efficient models, which will be accelerated by machine learning, they can better interpret these chemical fingerprints and more efficiently capture the methane feedback mechanism in global climate models.
